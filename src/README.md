# Rosetta's Node

> Interesting problems. Quickly described.

The problems listed here are a hand-picked selection from the programming [chrestomathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrestomathy) site, [Rosetta's Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code). I personally reviewed some 1,200 or so programming tasks, selecting the ones that didn't require a degree in advanced mathematics, weren't prescriptive about how to write the solution, and that were, above all, interesting.

### Obligatory

These are the problems that have been "done to death". Anything that was once interesting about these problems has since been nullified by their repetition. With that said, this collection wouldn't be complete without them.
